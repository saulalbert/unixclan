% The interpretation of the "^" operator inside a rule can be changed by
% placing a single character in the first column of a line by itself before that rule.  
% For this function the ^ symbol means AND in any order
% and the > symbol means AND in the specified order.
% These declarations apply to all following rules until reversed.
% The following line sets them to the AND in a determined order version
>
% += means variable can match any number of times
% + means OR

% Rules can be specified in long form "+|n +|n:*" or short form "+|n,|n:*"
% These markers specify the nature of the following string
% # prefix marker
% | part-of-speech marker
% ; stem of the word marker
% - suffix marker
% & nonconcatenated morpheme marker
% = English translation for the stem marker
% @ replacement word preceding [: ...] code marker
% * error code inside [* ...] code marker
% followed, optionally, by - or + and immediately followed by either one:
%     *        find any match
%     %        erase any match
%     string   find "string"
% o erase all other elements not specified by user
%     o%    erase all other elements
%     o~    erase postclitic element, if present
%     o$    erase preclitic element, if present
% ,		separates alternative elements
% Postclitic AND Preclitic exception:
%   Find postclitics with specific Morphosyntactic marker example:
%       |*,~|*   OR   ;*,~;*
%   Find preclitic with specific Morphosyntactic marker example:
%       |*,$|*   OR   ;*,$;*
%     *        find any match
%     string   find "string"

% Each rule starts with "RULENAME". It may have one or more conditionals group designated with "if".
% The "ADD" element is associated with "RULENAME" group only. 
% All other elements are associated with conditional group "if" of each rule "RULENAME".
% Conditional group can have only one "POINT", "INCLUDE", "EXCLUDE" or "DIFFERENT_STEMS".
% Other elements can be listed once or more.  All listing on each of those elements are treated as an "AND".
% Each of those elements listed separately is considered as an "OR".
