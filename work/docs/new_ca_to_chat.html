<h1><a name="_Toc515210501"></a> Integrating new CA transcription conventions into CLAN</h1>
<p>This is a set of proposed solutions for integrating new de-facto CA transcription standards into CLAN. It involves developing two conversion scripts: CHAT2CAlite and CAlite2CHAT. The CAlite standard is currently documented at <a href="https://github.com/saulalbert/CABNC/wiki/CHAT-CA-lite"> https://github.com/saulalbert/CABNC/wiki/CHAT-CA-lite </a></p>
<p>The proposed workflow for CA transcribers would involve working on CA transcripts in CAlite, then converting them into CHAT-CA/CHAT and vice versa. It should enable CA transcribers to contribute to the CABNC ( <a href="https://ca.talkbank.org/access/CABNC.html"> https://ca.talkbank.org/access/CABNC.html </a> ) incrementally.</p>
<p>The proposed solutions below attempt to require minimal adjustments to both CA conventions and to CLAN&rsquo;s existing CHECK and CHATTER scripts and the CLAN editor, but some may be required. Any changes that require changes to CLAN tools are <span class="hl">highlighted</span> below for discussion.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc515210502"></a>1. TCU-beginning capitalization issues:</h2>
<ul>
<li>CA capitalizes turn-initial TCUs because it provides a familiar visual marker for beginnings. However, we can 'fake' these caps since they only really occur in two positions:
<ol>
<li>turn-initial utterances at a new line after the speaker ID</li>
<li>at turn-initial utterances in incoming overlaps (since incoming speakers are 'starting up' a TCU-beginning).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Proposed solution: </strong>Conversion creates/removes 'fake' capitalizations, providing a simulation of visual familiarity for CA transcribers without damaging computer-readability:
<ul>
<li>CHAT2CAlite capitalizes any lowercase turn-initial utterance (i.e. any turn following a speaker code/colon/tab or following an 'lfloor' overlap marker).</li>
<li>CAlite2CHAT reverses this by lowercasing everything with with "lowcase +c +d *.cha +1.n", so caps at any other positions are removed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc515210503"></a>2. Overlap markers:</h2>
<ul>
<li>CA-lite can use CHAT-CA's lceil/rceil/lfloor/rfloor characters. We can also convert between CHAT &lt;overlap&gt; [&lt;] markers and lceil/rceil/lfloor/rfloor markers easily enough.</li>
<li>There is still a question about how to treat the following ambiguities:
<ol>
<li>CA's use of non-terminated lceil/lfloor overlap markers (e.g. where overlap often occurs, at TCU-endings, CA transcribers often omit a 'closing' square bracket)</li>
<li>CHAT's +&lt; 'lazy' overlap markers</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Proposed solutions: </strong>Force-close 'lazy' overlaps so they are unambiguous, which will create clear inaccuracies, but these can then be fixed incrementally.
<ul>
<li>CHAT2CAlite treats +&lt; 'lazy' overlap markers as indicating a fully overlapping incoming turn (by delimiting the turn with an lfloor/rfloor).</li>
<li>CAlite2CHAT force-closes unterminated CA overlap markers at the first occurring space or line-ending</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515210504"></a>3. Spacing out words:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Colons and spaces between words (rather than within words) is probably an adequate compromise here, as you suggest. I'll can add it to the (forthcoming) CA-lite user guidelines</li>
<li>The only issue here is that CA transcripts often use spacing to indicate relative timing of word production spatially on the page - colons are more specifically for indicating sound stretch. However, I don't think this is a major issue.</li>
<li><span class="hl"><strong>Proposed solution:</strong> If it does seem to be a major issue (I can test this with some CA transcribers), it should be easy to add U+00A0 (non breaking space) as a unicode character for spacing out words (just eye-candy for CLAN). </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc515210505"></a>4. Replacement words:</h2>
<ul>
<li>CA eye-dialect is impossible for lexical parsing, but it's not very common, so [: replacement] words should work OK, but they are visually obtrusive.</li>
<li>(re)placement words are less obtrusive, but are confusing for CA readers, since single parentheses denote 'transcriber hearing', not 'what the speaker meant to say'.</li>
<li>(re)placement words also break word/time alignment</li>
<li><strong>Proposed solutions: </strong>use eye-dialect and replacement words
<ul>
<li>Stick with [: replacement] words but allow them to be expanded/collapsed in CLAN (along with the audio timing bullets)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc515210506"></a>5. ((laughter))/&amp;=laughs</h2>
<ul>
<li>&amp;=laughs and ((laughter)) are equivalent, but one is a code and one is a description.</li>
<li>CA transcribers add arbitrary descriptions to ((double parentheses)) which makes them less code-like and more comment-like and means we can't convert reliably between &amp;=localevent and ((arbitrary description of local event)).</li>
<li><strong>Proposed solution: </strong>treat local event codes as comments
<ul>
<li>CHAT2CAlite converts [^ comments of any kind and length] into ((comments of any kind and length))</li>
<li>CAlite2CHAT converts ((comments)) back into [^ comments]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc515210507"></a>6. Capitalization for loudness</h2>
<ul>
<li>CA uses capitalization for loudness because (with a fixed width font) it maintains rough word/time alignment.</li>
<li>This is ambiguous for parsing when mixed with a) proper nouns c). colon-elongated 'loud' vowels e.g. A:::: in mid-turn</li>
<li><strong>Proposed solution:</strong> replace 'loudness' caps with fisheyes
<ul>
<li>CHAT2CAlite converts any fisheye delimited string from ◉caps◉ into CAPS</li>
<li>CAlite2CHAT
<ul>
<li>converts any CAPS into ◉caps◉, including within-word c◉ap◉s and any trailing col◉o:::◉ns</li>
<li>ignores proper nouns listed in the CLAN/lib folder</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc515210508"></a>7. Doubtful material</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is straight-forward - as you suggest &lt;doubful material&gt; [?] can be replaced with (doubtful material)</li>
<li><strong>Proposed solution:</strong>
<ul>
<li>CHAT2CAlite converts &lt;doubful material&gt; [?] to (doubtful material)</li>
<li>CAlite2CHAT converts (doubtful material) back to &lt;doubful material&gt; [?]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc515210509"></a>8. Intonation shifts within words and turns</h2>
<ul>
<li>Within words:
<ul>
<li> CA transcribers use colons and underlines within words because it maintains rough word/time alignment.</li>
<li> An underlined character followed by a colon to indicate falling-to-mid intonation - f<u>a</u>:lling</li>
<li> A character followed by an underlined colon to indicate rising-to-mid intonation - ri<u>:</u>sing</li>
<li> A down arrow (↓) before a pitch-falling syllable to indicate a falling to low intonation - f↓alling</li>
<li> An up arrow (↑) before a pitch-rising syllable to indicate a rising to high intonation - r↑ising</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Within turns:
<ul>
<li> CA transcribers often use '.' / ',' or '?' characters, often at possible TCU boundaries, to mark intonational shifts.</li>
<li> CHAT does not allow use of utterance delimiter/terminator characters such as '.', '!', or '?'.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Proposed solution: </strong>convert between CA's use of colon/underline intonation contours and '.', '!', or '?' within turns and CHAT's unicode arrows
<ul>
<li>CHAT2CAlite should convert:
<ul>
<li> within-word intonation shifts:</li>
<li> mi↗d ------&gt; mi:̲d</li>
<li> h⇗igh ------&gt; h↑igh (CA transcribers use a simple arrow within a word to indicate rising to high)</li>
<li> m↘id ------&gt; mi̲:d</li>
<li> l⇘ow ------&gt; l↓ow (CA transcribers use a simple arrow within a word to indicate falling to low)</li>
<li> within-turn intonation shifts:</li>
<li> falling. ----&gt; falling↘</li>
<li> mid-rise, ----&gt; rise↗</li>
<li> high-rise? ---&gt; rise⇗</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> CAlite2CHAT should convert
<ul>
<li> within-word intonation shifts:</li>
<li> mi<u>:</u>d ------&gt; mi↗d</li>
<li> h↑igh ------&gt; h⇗igh</li>
<li> m<u>i</u>:d ------&gt; m↘id</li>
<li> l↓ow ------&gt; l⇘ow</li>
<li> within-turn intonation shifts:</li>
<li> falling. ----&gt; falling↘</li>
<li> mid-rise, ----&gt; rise↗</li>
<li> high-rise? ---&gt; rise⇗</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NB: CHECK complains about ⇗, ↗, ↘, and ⇗ (but not ↑ or ↓) in turns that also include CHAT-style overlap markers. e.g. the following line gets this CHECK error: "* 22: Item [&gt;] must precede the utterance delimiter or CA delimiter":</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="hl">
<pre>	    22 *PS006: in fact the whole fam⇘ily was together for &lt;Mary's
		       wedding&gt; [&gt;] .
	<br /><br /></pre>
</div>
<h2><a name="_Toc515210510"></a> 9. Turn-final intonation / utterance terminators</h2>
<ul>
<li> CHAT:
<ul>
<li> requires utterance terminators . / ? / ! which represent 'declarative', 'questioning' and 'exclamatory' turn-final intonation.</li>
<li> usually terminates a turn with a space then a terminator (e.g. ' .' / ' ?' / ' !').</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> CA:
<ul>
<li> separates pragmatics from prosody, so '?' means 'rising', but not 'questioning', and '.' means 'falling' but not 'declarative'.</li>
<li> CA always puts the final intonation marker adjacent to the final character without a space.</li>
<li> doesn't usually use unit-final intonation markers where the turn ends in a 'level' or unmarked intonation (&infin;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <strong>Proposed solutions: </strong>force-add/remove default ' .' CHAT-style utterance terminators where necessary.
<ul>
<li> CAlite2CHAT automatically adds CHAT-style utterance terminators (space then terminator) to all lines in a transcript</li>
<li> <em>exception</em>: ignore lines with valid CA-style turn-final intonation markers '.', '!', or '?' (adjacent to turn-final characters).</li>
<li> CHAT2CAlite automatically removes CHAT-style terminators (space then terminator) from all lines in a transcript</li>
<li> <em>exception</em>: ignore lines with valid CA-style turn-final intonation markers '.', '!', or '?' (adjacent to turn-final characters).</li>
<li> NB: since ',' is a valid CA-style turn-final intonation marker, but not a CHAT utterance terminator, still add/remove a CHAT-style terminator (' .')</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc515210511"></a>10. Latching</h2>
<ul>
<li> CA uses equals signs to mitigate the visual ambiguity of laying out talk that may be contiguous across multiple turns when they are listed vertically down a page.
<ul>
<li> as you note, mid-turn latching on the same line shows that two units are 'run together' without a discernible break. e.g. "Listen.&asymp;ok wait hold on": Hepburn &amp; Bolden (2017; p. 47, extract 18)</li>
<li> between-speaker latching is marked with two '&asymp;' signs so that the transcript reader knows (at the end of the previous line) not to read any gap between speakers.</li>
<li> within-speaker latching across multiple lines with two '≋' signs shows that the same-speaker turn continues uninterrupted, despite the visual separation, e.g. Hepburn &amp; Bolden (2017; p. 47, extract 20):</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/Hnc0J2K.png" width="362" height="103" /></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Proposed solution: </strong>maintain both '&asymp;' and '≋' codes, add spaces either side of within-turn &asymp; marks
<ul>
<li> CAlite2CHAT adds a space either side of a within-turn '&asymp;' mark, so as not to confuse mor into treating it as a new word missing from ar.cut</li>
<li> CHAT2CAlite removes spaces from either side of within-turn '&asymp;' marks to recreate the visual effect of words running together/rushed-through</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc515210512"></a> 11. Faster, slower, quiet, &amp; other potentially doubled unicode markers</h2>
<ul>
<li> It's very straight forward to convert between CHAT's &amp; CA's markers faster (∆), slower (&nabla;), quieter(&deg;) and other unicode marks.</li>
<li> However, doubling up markers for emphasis leads to problems passing CHECK e.g.</li>
</ul>
<pre>    20 *PS006: er saw Mary and ∆∆Andrew∆∆ &lt;and&gt; [&gt;] .
</pre>
<ul>
<li> throws an error "*20 : Upper case letters are not allowed inside a word." since it is presumably checking ar.cut for '∆Andrew' instead of 'Andrew'.</li>
<li> <span class="hl">Using this solution would require changing CHECK to allow doubled-up unicode markers for faster (∆), slower (&nabla;), quieter(&deg;), creaky (⁎), smile (☺) and louder (◉) marks </span></li>
<li> Similarly, a single (unmatched) '&lt;' is a "jump start" (see Hepburn &amp; Bolden (2017; p. 47, extract 20)), meaning that the following word is hearably 'rushed started'.</li>
</ul>
<pre>    20 *PS006: er saw Mary and ∆Andrew &lt;and&gt; [&gt;] .
</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">o throws an error "*20 : This character must be used in pairs. See if any are unmatched."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">o <span class="hl">Using this solution would require changing CHECK to allow single, unmatched 'faster' (∆) marks </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">o Similarly, CA transcribers use unmatched quieter(&deg;) symbols adjacent to the following quiet word (see Hepburn &amp; Bolden (2017, p. 57)).</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Proposed solution: </strong>
<ul>
<li> CAlite2CHAT converts &gt;single delimted&lt; and &gt;&gt;double delimited&lt;&lt; markers into ∆single delimited∆ and ∆∆double delimited∆∆ markers for faster (∆), slower (&nabla;), and quieter(&deg;) talk.</li>
<li> CAlite2CHAT converts unmatched jump start (&lt;) markers (i.e. unmatched on one line) into unmatched (∆) marks.</li>
<li> CHAT2CAlite converts ∆single delimited∆ and ∆∆double delimited∆∆ markers into &gt;single delimted&lt; and &gt;&gt;double delimited&lt;&lt; markers for faster (∆), slower (&nabla;), and quieter(&deg;) talk.</li>
<li> <span class="hl">CHECK to allow single unmatched quieter (&deg;) and faster (∆) symbols adjacent to the following quieter or rush-started word.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515210513"></a> 12. Voice quality marks (creaky / smile / tremulous)</h2>
<ul>
<li> CA transcribers use '#' delimiters to mark creaky voice, CHAT-CA uses '⁎'.</li>
<li> CA transcribers use '&pound;' to mark smile voice, CHAT-CA uses '☺'</li>
<li> <span class="hl">CA transcribers are using '~' as a voice quality marker to denote tremulous voice, </span></li>
<li> <strong>Proposed solution:</strong>
<ul>
<li> Add '~' as a new unicode marker (at the moment CHECK complains "Item '~' can not be followed by the next symbol).</li>
<li> CAlite2CHAT converts all '#' and '&pound;' delimiters to '⁎' and '☺' delimiters</li>
<li> CHAT2CAlite converts all '⁎' and '☺' delimiters to '#' and '&pound;' delimiters</li>
<li> <span class="hl">as above, change CHECK to allow doubling up of creaky (⁎), smile (☺), tremulous (~), and louder (◉) marks. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc515210514"></a> 13. Prosodic stress and loudness (underlines and CAPS)</h2>
<ul>
<li> CA marks moderate changes in pitch, volume and prosodic stress with <u>underlines,</u> which is different to LOUDNESS (see point 6 above).</li>
<li> However, you might also have changes in pitch, volume and prosodic stress WITHIN L<u>OUD</u> TALK. (see Hepburn &amp; Bolden (2017; p. 58)).</li>
<li> The capitalization issue should be solved by using louder (◉) marks as delimiters.</li>
<li> The underlining issue should be solved with CLAN's existing solution: U+0332 (combining low line).</li>
<li> Alternatively, if we want to conserve at least some of this information about prosodic stress for parsing, we could insert the CHAT primary prosodic stress unicode symbol U+02C8 (modifier vertical line) before the first underlined character</li>
<li> <strong>Proposed solution:</strong>
<ul>
<li> CAlite2CHAT converts all CA̲P̲S̲ into ◉ca̲p̲s̲◉ (as above)</li>
<li> CHAT2CAlite converts all ◉ca̲p̲s̲◉ back into CA̲P̲S̲</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <strong><em>alternatively (if it's useful)</em></strong>
<ul>
<li> CAlite2CHAT could convert CA̲P̲S̲ into ◉c<strong>ˈ</strong>a̲p̲s̲◉</li>
<li> CHAT2CAlite could convert ◉c<strong>ˈ</strong>a̲p̲s̲◉ back into CA̲P̲S̲</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515210515"></a> 14. Aspiration &amp; details of laughter within talk</h2>
<ul>
<li> <em> This is the most complex case with the least chance of consistent success, but below are a few ideas that could work (but will need testing and some small amendment to CLAN) </em></li>
<li> CA transcribers are using detailed markers of aspiration and laughter to arrange pulses of laughter into the same kind of rough, visual word/time alignment.</li>
<li> These include: outbreaths (hhh) inbreaths (∙hhh) in elevated volume (HHH) and (∙HHH) or decreased volume (&deg;hhh&deg;) or (&deg;∙hhh&deg;) - sometimes unmatched
<ul>
<li> NB: they are not using colons (as in elongation of vowel sounds) but multiple characters to mark continuation e.g. 'hhhhh'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> The 'h' or 'H' character is used within words enclosed in parentheses (h) or (H) e.g. 'awa(h)y' or 'thi(h)nk'.</li>
<li> <strong>Proposed solutions:</strong>
<ul>
<li> CAlite2CHAT converts any consecutive series of 'hh' or 'HH' characters into strings of 'ħħ' (U+0127 : latin small letter h with stroke) or 'ἩἩ' (U+1F29 : greek capital 'eta' with dasia).</li>
<li> including mixed sequences e.g. hHHHh ---&gt; ħἩἩἩħ</li>
<li> <span class="hl">NB: this would involve adding ħ as a new unicode symbol for CLAN </span></li>
<li> CAlite2CHAT converts within-word laugh particles e.g. wha(h)t or wha(H)t into whaħt or whaH't</li>
<li> CHAT2CAlite converts within-word laugh particles e.g. whaħt or whaH't back into wha(h)t or wha(H)t</li>
<li> CHAT2CAlite wouldn't have to do the reverse conversion on consecutive series of 'HH' or ħħ characters since CLAN would treat ħ and Ἡ as eye candy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc515210516"></a> Other issues (which do not require any changes to CA-lite or CHAT-CA)</h2>
<p><strong>Pitch shift arrows as delimiters or marking whole words as pitch-shifted </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CA transcribers mark whole words as markedly pitch-shifted using arrows before the ↓word</li>
<li>A series of words can be delimited as markedly pitch-shifted with ↓one arrow on either side↓</li>
<li>CHAT does not recognize arrows as delimiters, but rather as single episodes of pitch-shift</li>
<li><strong>Proposed solution: </strong> none really needed, since CHECK does not complain about using arrows as delimiters</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pause duration and detailed per-word timing:</strong></p>
<p>No solutions needed here, since (0.4) and precise timing work together fine, and I agree that it is overkill for the CABNC to do precise timing. It is a pity to lose the CABNC-XML per-word timings data, and not to be able to enrich the original BNC-XML with the CABNC's precisely timed transcripts though. Thinking ahead, since I added per-word timing to the CABNC-XML using Peggy Renwick's HTK forced alignment data in the first place, there's no reason we couldn't ask her or someone else to do the forced alignment again using the CABNC's more precise base-line transcripts (the BNC-XML is horribly inaccurate) once they're complete in a few year's time. Hopefully forced-alignment technology will also be much better by then.</p>
